                <b>AB Admin</b> is the most extensive WebApp template for admin dashboards and control panels. It is a responsive
                HTML template that is based on the CSS framework Bootstrap 3+ and the javascript framework AngularJs 1.7.2.
                It utilizes all of the Bootstrap components in its design and re-styles many commonly used plugins to create
                a consistent design that can be used as a user interface for backend applications. All the CSS styles used
                are defined in LESS files for easy use. AB Admin is based on a modular design, which allows it to be easily
                customized and built upon.

                be included into the App Views.
